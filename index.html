         <p> When COVID-19 hit Columbia, Missouri in March of 2020 everything changed, including the education sysytem. Since March, our K-12 students were forced to learn at home through iPads. Starting in August of 2020, my team and I followed the adaptations Columbia Public Schools' made to the education system, along with the response from parents and students. This three-part series dives into-- the hardships of first-year teachers learning what it means to be a virtual educator, parents who are searching for better options for their kids and the mental, physical and emotional health of students who are forced to learn remotely. </p>

               <h2>Teachers finally get to meet their students in person</h2>
               <p> In August of 2020 Columbia Public Schools decided to start K-12 students remotely. This meant teachers were preparing lessons and teaching their students behind a screen. But, on October 12 the school board decided to open schools for elementary students starting the 19. Maggie Robbins, a kindergarten teacher, tells us her experiences being virtual and her excitement to go back in person. </p>

               <h2>Parents search for in-person learning instruction</h2>
               <p> After a few weeks in person for elementary students, the Columbia School Board made the decision Nov. 9 to move all students back online, and many parents aren't happy with the desicion. Instead of waiting for  in-person classes to resume, parents are seeking transfers to private schools for their children in hopes of a better education by in-person learning.</p>

               <h2>Virtual learning causes declines in student health</h2>
               <p> Many students never expected to stay at home and learn for a semester and a half. Minimal socialization and changing routines have affected students mental health and motivation. Madison Holmes shares her experiences being a high school senior this year and mental health experts share new trends.</p>
