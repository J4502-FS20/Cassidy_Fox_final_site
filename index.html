  <h1> COVID-19 Education </h1>
  <p>Since COVID-19 hit Columbia, Missouri in March of 2020 everything has changed, including education. Now, our K-12 students are forced to learn at home on thier own technical devices. For a semester, my team and I followed Columbia Public Schools, it's teachers and students to learn how they are being forced to adapt. </p>

<h4> Back to school means first time face-to-face for new teachers and students </h4>
<p> In August of 2020 Columbia Public Schools decided to start K-12 students remotely. This meant teachers were preparing lessons and teaching their students behind a screen. Maggie Robbins, a kindergarten teacher, tells us her experiences being virtual and her excitement to go back in person. </p>

<h4> COMING SOON: Parents seek transfers to private schools for their children in hopes of better education by in-person learning </h4>
  <p> When Columbia Public Schools sent students home in March of 2020, many parents didn't expect remote learning to last into the new school year. But some parents made plans to transfer their children to private schools with hopes that in-person learning would be the best way to ensure their child is getting quality education.</p>

<h4> COMING SOON: Students face changes in nutrition, socialization and mental health since learning from home </h4>
  <p> Many students never expected to stay at home and learn for 6 months. But not only are lunch times and recess taken away,summers were spent friend-less too. Minimal socialization and changing routines can affect students mental health and behavior. </p>
