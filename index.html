  <p> When COVID-19 hit Columbia, Missouri in March of 2020 everything changed, including the education sysytem. Since March, our K-12 students were forced to learn at home through iPads. Starting in August of 2020, my team and I followed Columbia Public Schools' changes and adaptations to learning along the response from parents and students. This three-part series dives into the hardships of first-year teachers learning what it means to be a virtual educator, parents who are searching for better options for their kids and the mental, physical and emotional health of students learning remotely. </p>

<h2>Teachers finally get to meet their students in person</h2>

<p> In August of 2020 Columbia Public Schools decided to start K-12 students remotely. This meant teachers were preparing lessons and teaching their students behind a screen. Maggie Robbins, a kindergarten teacher, tells us her experiences being virtual and her excitement to go back in person. </p>

<h2>Parents search for in-person learning instruction</h2>

<p> CPS made the decision to keep students online Nov. 9 and many parents aren't happy with the desicion. Instead of waiting for CPS to move in-person, parents are seeking transfers to private schools for their children in hopes of better education by in-person learning.</p>

<h2>COMING SOON: Students face change health since virtual learning</h2>

<p> Many students never expected to stay at home and learn for 6 months. But not only are lunch times and recess taken away,summers were spent friend-less too. Minimal socialization and changing routines can affect students mental health and behavior in the long-run. </p>
