  <h1> COVID-19 Education in 2020 </h1>
  <p>Since COVID-19 hit Columbia, Missouri in March of 2020 everything has changed, including education. Now, our K-12 students are forced to learn at home on thier own technical devices. In the fall of 2020, my team and I followed Columbia Public Schools' changes and adaptations to learning- and the response from parents and students. In this three-part series we dive into the hardships of first-year teachers learning what it means to be an educator behind an iPad, parents who are searching for the best option for their kids and the mental, physical and emotional health of students in the system. </p>

<h4> Teachers finally get to meet their students in-person </h4>
<p> In August of 2020 Columbia Public Schools decided to start K-12 students remotely. This meant teachers were preparing lessons and teaching their students behind a screen. Maggie Robbins, a kindergarten teacher, tells us her experiences being virtual and her excitement to go back in person. </p>
<h2><a href="private_school_option.html">In-person school is only available at private schools</a></h2>
<h4> Parents search for in-person learning instruction </h4>
  <p> CPS made the decision to keep students online Nov. 9 and many parents aren't happy with the desicion. Instead of waiting for CPS to move in-person, parents are seeking transfers to private schools for their children in hopes of better education by in-person learning.</p>
<h2><a href="student_mental_health.html">How does remote school really impact student health?</a></h2>
<h4> COMING SOON: Students face changes in behavioral, physical and mental health since learning from home </h4>
  <p> Many students never expected to stay at home and learn for 6 months. But not only are lunch times and recess taken away,summers were spent friend-less too. Minimal socialization and changing routines can affect students mental health and behavior in the long-run. </p>
