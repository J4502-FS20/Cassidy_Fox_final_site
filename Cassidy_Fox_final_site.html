  <hi> COVID-19 Education
  <a><img src= "rock bridge school" alt= "Rock Bridge School" </a>
  <p>Since COVID-19 hit Columbia, Missouri in March of 2020 everything has changed, including education. Now, our K-12 students are forced to learn at home on thier own technical devices. For a semester, my team and I followed Columbia Public Schools, it's teachers and students to learn how they are being forced to adapt. </p>
