<p>Madison Holmes, a senior at Hickman High School, didn’t get the year she expected. Instead of celebrating her last year of high school with her friends, she has to settle for brief interactions behind a screen.</p>

<p>“It’s my senior year, I should be thriving, and yet I sit at home and I'm alone,” Holmes said. </p>

<p>Senior year was supposed to be “easy breezy,” Holmes said, but because so much has changed things feel more stressful.</p>

<p>“I think it's a little bit of an added stress than you would normally expect from your senior year,” she said.</p>

<p>Holmes has spent her entire semester on Zoom, being one of the 9,908 middle and high schoolers in the Columbia Public Schools (CPS) system.  Virtual learning has impacted her opportunities to stay involved with organizations, keep in touch with friends and stay motivated to excel in her coursework — all of which can affect students’ mental health.</p>

<p>Holmes is taking both CPS and Moberly Area Career Center (MACC) courses, planning to major in plant sciences when she enters college. She said juggling both has left her feeling drained.</p>

<p>“Normally, you would never have days where you just do nothing on a school day. But it just becomes so overwhelming,” Holmes said.  “... I just feel like I can't get motivated to do any sort of work whatsoever.” </p>

<p>Holmes said she and her friends feel this way because there is nothing to look forward to.  She is active in National Future Farmers of America (FFA), an organization that educates students on agricultural leadership. However, the pandemic forced many of their events either online or cancelled entirely. Outside of extracurriculars, she has few reasons, if any, to look forward to class. Before, at least she could talk with her friends.</p>

<p>“It's just another kick in the side of like, ‘Well, why would I care about my grades if I don't even get the reward of being involved?’” Holmes said. </p>

<p>This lack of socialization is one of the challenges that come with the virtual environment, said Dr. Laine Young-Walker, a child psychiatrist with MU Health Care.</p>

<p>“Some things are lost from online learning,” Young-Walker said. You know, social, emotional engagement, development is critical to kids as they grow up. And so now they're alone, and they don't have that ability to engage with other kids.”</p>

<p>Young-Walker explains social engagement is critical because it helps students develop social norms and appropriate behavior.</p>

<p>“Kids and babies are developing in ways with other people that are shaping their engagement with others,” Young-Walker said. “If you halt that, if you prevent that engagement with others, then later, it may be harder for people to have relationships, to be able to know social norms, that kind of thing.” </p>

<p>Young-Walker said a lack of motivation is another common trend among students learning remotely, and it can be dangerous.</p>

<p>“Kids sometimes are getting frustrated with the online learning and quitting or giving up,” Young-Walker said. “And that's what you don't want is for them to get frustrated with school and give up, because it may be harder to get them back on the train.” </p>

<p>Rock Bridge High School physical education teacher, Van Vanatta, has seen the same thing in his students.</p>

<p>“Over 50% of the students aren't involved,” Vanatta said. “And it doesn't matter if it's PE. There is a major problem- and it's getting worse- because the lack of ‘I don't care anymore. I don't want to do this anymore.’” </p>

<p>Young-Walker said virtual learning has affected students in a variety of ways. She emphasized that while every child has different levels of resilience, consistency is vital to growth. </p>

<p>“The challenges that have existed with the education system have been the uncertainty and change.” Young-Walker said. “(The) ‘We're going to bring you in, but now we got to send you back home.’ And so for kids, they like consistency, they like routine, they like standard.” </p>

<h6>Mental health impacts</h6>

<p>Vanatta said he has talked to students and parents who have been struggling with online school and new mental health issues.</p>

<p>“I had a young lady in one of my classes the other day say, ‘I feel like I'm drowning.’ And that's scary,” Vanatta said.</p>

<p>Vanatta said he understands the pandemic is an issue to take seriously, but also sees the negative impacts of online school.</p>

<p>“We need to get these kids back, we are losing a generation and turning kids into depression,” Vanatta said.</p>

<p>In a normal year, school counselors  offer mental health support for their students. This is anything but a normal year, Rock Bridge outreach counselor Lesley Thalhuber said.</p>

<p>“I have students making Zoom appointments with me for mental health, just check-ins, and to track some top problems and goals they're working on,” Thalhuber said. </p>

<p>One benefit of Zoom, she said, is that she can show her students a graph of their mental health journey, which can include things like a mood or a sleep tracker. This can help students visualize their progress. Another upside is privacy during a mental health crisis. Instead of drawing attention to themselves by leaving a full room, they can simply end their Zoom call.</p>

<p>“When you're in class and you're like, ‘Oh, my God, I need to go talk to somebody now’ or ‘I have to get away,’ but what do you do?” Thalhuber said. “Everybody knows you're leaving the classroom.”</p>

<p>The change from a physical classroom to a virtual one has been helpful to some of Thalhuber’s students with social anxiety. Now, they don’t have to worry about raising their hands. Because of this, some students prefer learning online.</p>

<p>“They can turn their Zoom cameras off, they can chat out their answers or verbally state their answers. There's a variety of ways to engage without the feeling of students looking at them or judging them,” Thalhuber said.</p>

<p>A drawback to the virtual setting is not being able to help with crisis situations quickly, like when a student is overwhelmed, distressed or is a risk to their safety. </p>

<p>“We're a resource that (helps) manage (situations), hopefully, so it doesn't get to that crisis mode in the future.” Thalhuber said. “I think in the past that may have come to my doorstep right away. So there's maybe a little bit of a lag time and getting to me now where there wasn't before.” </p>

<p>This doesn’t change the reality for students like Holmes, though, who saw how her generation was being impacted and wanted change. She shared her experiences with the Columbia School Board on November 9.  She stood in front of the board members, teachers and parents to advocate for an in-person learning option.</p>

<p>In the end, the board opted to continue virtual learning- for now. On December 11 there were 1,006 active cases in Boone County.</p>

<p>“As board members, they can disagree with my opinion and think we shouldn't go back to school, but they can't deny the experiences that I've had this semester ... only we can advocate for ourselves because nobody else has gone through this before,” Holmes said.</p>

<p>Columbia Public Schools is set to return on January 11 for elementary school kids and January 19 for middle and high school students. There is no meeting scheduled to discuss other options for CPS students.</p>
