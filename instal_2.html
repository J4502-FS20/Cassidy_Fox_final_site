  <h2> COMING SOON: Parents assess options for in-person instruction
  <p> When Columbia Public Schools sent students home in March of 2020, many parents didn't expect remote learning to last into the new school year. But some parents made plans to transfer their children to private schools with hopes that in-person learning would be the best way to ensure their child is getting quality education.</p>
  <h6> Private School Sanitation Policies </h6>
  <p> Private schools like Our Lady of Lourdes are taking extreme health and safety precautions to keep the school open. The school installed automatic sinks and soap dispensers and have been sanitizing between class visits. The principal, Elaine Hassemer says, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeccaNewton827/status/1324442914622074880?s=20" target= "_blank">"Getting them to school is such a big piece of good mental health."</a>
