<p> Emily Smith wants what is best for her two sons and will do anything to ensure they receive the school structure they need to succeed. This desire drove them away from Columbia Public Schools (CPS) online structure and toward Columbia’s private schools. Finding affordable private education; however, can prove difficult.<p>
<p> Regardless, Smith decided to send her fifth-grade son to Christian Fellowship, a private school in west Columbia. She says he has different learning needs; the remote learning structure did not allow him to thrive.</p>
<p> “That was the most important thing for us was to get him in seat with peers, with a teacher in person - just as normal as we could set it up for him,” Smith said. </p>
<p> Some CPS families, like Smith, want more than at-home learning for their kids. Many parents have desperately turned to the private school system, even if it comes with financial sacrifices. New transfers have led private schools to report an increase in enrollment and heavy wait lists, with huge spikes in inquiries. Capacity levels also add a new burden to families searching for options. </p>
<p> Because of necessity, Smith allowed her eighth-grade son to remain online at Gentry Middle School, but now as school online continues, it has been harder to adjust. </p>
<p> “My oldest – it's just really hard for him,” Smith said. “He will ask me questions like, ‘How come he can go to school and I'm not going to school?’” </p>
<p> CPS families were notified March 17 by their schools that students would not be attending school in-person for the remainder of the school year. Five months later, in a meeting on Aug. 31, the CPS Board announced its plan to move the 2020-2021 school year online indefinitely.</p>
<p> While Smith hoped that the ruling would reverse, on Nov. 9, the school board decided to send CPS to virtual instruction for the remainder of the year. After that decision, Smith felt she had no other choice – she started transfer paperwork for her oldest son. She is hoping Christian Fellowship will allow him to start attending in January.</p>
<p> "I feel like we're kind of stuck,” Smith said. “But it’s not a good environment to have him sitting in front of an iPad screen all day.” </p>
<p> But, with high wait list numbers at Christian Fellowship, she isn’t sure he will be admitted. Still, Smith says her eldest son is looking forward to going to school. </p>
<p> “I think after being out for so long... he’s ready to be in a classroom,” Smith said. </p>
<p> At first, Smith never thought having her both of her children in private school was possible. But, many families, including Smiths are finding a way to make it happen. </p>
<p> “One of the schools I looked at ... an eighth grader and a fifth grader total together with $30,000,” Smith said. “That was my college tuition.” </p>
<p> Private school tuition can cost as much as college tuition. For Catholic baptized individuals, options for free education are available. In place of tuition, families pay tithings to their church. However, for non-baptized individuals, the cost of a private education can become very high. </p>
<p> Our Lady of Lourdes offers a $4,300 tuition for non-baptized students, with discounts applied for families who send multiple children to the institution. Tolton Catholic, on the other hand, costs $10,170 for non-baptized students, and $7,920 for baptized students. These numbers do not include additional costs to parents like uniforms and school lunches. For parents who are accustomed to sending their student to school for no cost, this can be a major adjustment that requires financial strategy and sacrifices.</p>

<h6> A decline in enrollment </h6>

<p> CPS has taken a hit from COVID-19 and remote learning implemented by the Board of Education. With a lowering overall CPS enrollment, and private schools facing larger headcounts than they’ve ever seen, parents aren't the only ones struggling to adapt. </p>
<p> Community Relations Director Michelle Baumstark attributed the decline in enrollment solely to the preschool and kindergarten levels in the CPS system. </p>
<p> “We have an increase in high school enrollment, and an increase in, basically, secondary enrollment,” Baumstark said. “We’ve seen the reduction is actually in preschool and kindergarten meaning individuals are choosing to wait a year … In fact, our enrollment is up in all those other areas.” </p>
<p> Following a request for records, Baumstark provided an official spreadsheet reflecting static headcount for years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Contrary to her original statement, the data showed a decline at the elementary and middle school levels across all grades.</p>

</div>

<p>Overall, CPS has seen a decline above the kindergarten level within Columbia at a little over 2%. Across the state, enrollment has decreased 2.5 to 3%.</p>

 <h6> Private school enrollment </h6>

<p>Private schools around Columbia are seeing an increase in enrollment as parents look for options that don’t include learning alone from an iPad.</p>
<p>Columbia Independent School - where Smith hopes to send both her kids - reported a 400% increase in inquiries from families. Director of Admissions Kari Dowell said almost all of these came from the public school system. </p>
<p>“In a typical year, we might have 25 families reaching out with inquiries” said Dowell. “This year, this August, we had 125.” </p>
<p>Principal Elaine Hassemer of Our Lady of Lourdes Interparish School (OLLIS), who we spoke with Oct. 29, says that the school is nearly at capacity. </p>
<p>“I mean, we’ve had calls today about applications,” Hassemer said. “We have a significant waitlist now. People are looking for options.”</p>
<p>The waitlist at OLLIS exceeds 100 students, and they aren’t the only private school experiencing this.</p>
<p>Administrators from private institutions remained vague on the specific enrollment numbers, but both Heritage Academy and Tolton Catholic reported an increase in enrollment, leading to maximum capacity this year.</p>

<h6> The families of CPS </h6>

<p>Other parents are just as desperate for some sense of normalcy for their kids. That is what led Carmen Adams to transfer her child to Tolton Catholic.</p>
<p>She felt the move was essential for her daughter Lilly who suffers from stress-triggered Alopecia, an autoimmune disorder. Massive life changes - like starting at a new school - are not ideal for Lilly, but learning in person is necessary for success, Adams said. </p>
<p>“Most of the parents and kids I know, they all basically stopped learning,” Adams said. “They were doing their assignments or whatever was expected of them, but that was about it.” </p>
<p>Adams wished parents were consulted in the decision process of moving online. She believed access to education should not change based on the school.</p>
<p>When families are buying their homes, oftentimes their child’s education sits high on their priority list. They move for school, they pay taxes for the school and ultimately, when that school is no longer providing the education they expected, it can devastate. </p>
<p>“Fortunately, we have family support...but maybe [other families] don’t have that option,” Adams said. “I honestly don't know how some of the families are doing it.”</p>
<p>Despite the challenges associated with transferring schools, Adams knows her sacrifice will allow Lilly to thrive.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have to make these sacrifices, but in the end, it's good. Is it worth transferring? Absolutely,” Adams said. “They shouldn't be isolated like that, they shouldn't be alone or away from their friends, away from the activities that you do in school, even outside of academics, that's such a big part of growing up.”</p>

 <h6> Parent response </h6>

<p>Parents are angry over the board’s decision to move online, and they aren’t backing down. They don’t believe the board is keeping the families in mind.</p>
<p>“I have no faith that even though their goal is to come back in January, I don’t think they will,” Smith said. </p>
<p>Smith spoke out at the school board meeting Monday with other concerned parents and teachers. While she spoke in favor of sending kids in-person, other parents and teacher spoke to the opposite opinion.</p>
<p>Many spoke about the importance of prioritizing safety, and the motion to keep middle and high schoolers virtual passed with the support of six of the seven board members.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was the best decision for the students at all,” Smith said after appearing at the board’s meeting. “I think it comes down to a staffing problem...I also think that quarantining rules for students and teachers are ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Community Relations Director Baumstark says, the board, administration and parents all want the same thing.</p>
<p>“Our goal is we want to be in person, we want to have a regular school year, who doesn't want that? Everyone wants that,” Baumstark said.</p>
<p>The school board is set to follow up in the start of the new year.</p>
<p>“The board has set a goal for us, they've set January 19,” Baumstark said. “They want kids to come back on January 11th for elementary and then January 19th for secondary elementary.” </p>
<p>With the Columbia School Board deciding to continue classes remotely this year, if parents decide to transfer, private schools may not have the space to accommodate them.</p>

  <h6> Private School Sanitation Policies </h6>
  <p> Private schools like Our Lady of Lourdes are taking extreme health and safety precautions to keep the school open. The school installed automatic sinks and soap dispensers and have been sanitizing between class visits. The principal, Elaine Hassemer says, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeccaNewton827/status/1324442914622074880?s=20" target= "_blank">"Getting them to school is such a big piece of good mental health."</a>
